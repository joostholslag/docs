Medblocks UI VsCode Extension is an inevitable part of our product. This extension is to help develop fast development of openEHR templates. It renders the Web-Templates in a tree format, where you are able to copy the snippets individually, with various options to select from; and also as the whole template. You are also able to copy the aql paths of each archetype from the extension.

The Medblocks-ui web components are compatible with a wide range of frameworks and libraries so that you can use our service in any of your projects for capturing the data which use OPENEHR or FHIR services.&#x20;

### Setup
